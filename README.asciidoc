== Install K3s (lightweight Kubernetes)

//todo:

== Setup Persistent Storage

For persistent storage, I have:

* Enabled NFS on my Synology NAS
* Created a Shared Folder (called ... "Kubernetes"). All PersistentVolumes will be created in this folder.
* Allowed access to this shared folder to be accessed by the cluster IPs (see screenshot below)

* Used the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner/tree/master/deploy[NFS subdir provisioner], which I have included in this repo. Install with `make nfs-install`.
